# Power Outages Analysis
Analysis of power outages for DSC 80 at UCSD

By Alex Frederick and Sam Ouyang


# Introduction


In this project, we analyzed a dataset about power outages in the United States. The dataset includes information about the location, climate, and economic characteristics of the locations of outages.

        Need to decide what one question we want to say it's centered around here. what specifically about severe weather? maybe come back to this after finishing the whole thing

The dataset has 1534 rows and 56 columns. The dataset contains a lot of valuable information in all of these columns, but will only keep 11 columns that are relevant to our question about severe weather. Those columns are listed below with a description of each.



**YEAR:** Indicates the year when the outage event occurred
**MONTH:** Indicates the month when the outage event occurred
